### :woman_technologist: About Me:

I'm a graduate student pursuing a M.S. in Data Science and Public Policy at Georgetown University in Washington, DC. I'm also an experienced international relations professional and traveler with 20 countries and 35 states under my belt. I'm currently pursuing summer internship opportunities where data science and public interest intersect. See below for examples of my work!
