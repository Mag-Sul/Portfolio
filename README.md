### :woman_technologist: About Me:

I'm a graduate student pursuing a M.S. in Data Science and Public Policy at Georgetown University in Washington, DC. I'm also an experienced international relations professional focused on program management and communications. I'm currently open to opportunities where data science and public interest intersect. See below for examples of my work!

### Class Research (Python and R):

ðŸ“˜ **Data Science III: Just Jargon or Policy Priorities? Text Analysis of Secretary of State Remarks for the Biden and Trump Administrations (Python)**

*Summary:* Public affairs materials point to both policy priorities and how we talk about those policy priorities. This is particularly relevant when comparing the priorities of presidential administrations from different political parties. I scraped 1,973 public remarks from the Office of the Secretary of State websites for the current U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken (Biden Administration) and his predecessor, Secretary Michael Pompeo (Trump Administration). I then conducted both exploratory and predictive analysis on these documents to understand how government public affairs materials do or do not reveal key facts about U.S. foreign policy, particularly for changes between administrations of different political parties. I found that these public remarks revealed both diplomatic "business as usual" reveal both and key policy priorities under each administration. Read the final report [here](). 

*Techniques:* Webscraping (`beautifulsoup` and `requests`), TF-IDF, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees/Random Forest

ðŸ“˜ **Data Science II: Real Life Leslie Knopes: Factors Contributing to the Proportion of Women Candidates for Local Office in the United States (Python)**

*Summary:* Much data and research exists about factors influencing the number of women in national politics globally but there is little understanding of these same elements at the local level. In my project, I examine which social, economic, and political factors are most relevant to predicting higher proportions of women candidates for local office in the United States. I employ a gender guessing package on candidate-level precinct returns from the 2018 elections and combine the resulting data with county-level factors related to demography, economics, election history, and reproductive healthcare. My resulting dataset provides one of the most conclusively available datasets on women running for local office in the U.S. Read the final report [here](https://github.com/Mag-Sul/Portfolio/blob/main/class_research/Real%20Life%20Leslie%20Knopes/Real%20Life%20Leslie%20Knopes_%20Factors%20Contributing%20to%20the%20Proportion%20of%20Women%20Candidates%20for%20Local%20Office%20in%20the%20United%20States%20-%20Sullivan.pdf). 

*Techniques:* Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression and random forests.

ðŸ“˜ **Stats I: School-Aged Violence and Potential Impact on Proportion of Women in Public Office (R)**

*Summary:* Initially we planned to examine the relationship between online violence against women and women's political participation. However, this is an emerging data area and many data gaps remain. Instead, we pivoted to examine violence in relation to another proposed element contributing to the low numbers of women in elected office: the influence of childhood experiences. For example, based on survey data from 1,600 children ages 6 to 12, researchers Bos, et al concluded that girls report less interest in running for political office than their boy peers (Bos, Angela L., et al). Another study by Fox and Lawless found that even factors such as participation in school sports influences whether or not a girl says they want to run for office someday (Fox and Lawless, "Girls Just Wanna Not Run"). Our hypothesis is that the levels of violence against girls in high school will have a negative correlation on the levels of women in politics at both the state and federal level. In our study, we analyzed 2015 state-level data on the percent of high school students experiencing harassment or bullying and dating violence, and state statutes on violence and employment, domestic violence, sexual violence, stalking, and gun ownership as well as 2015 data on women in congress and state legislatures. See the full presentation of results [here](https://github.com/Mag-Sul/Portfolio/blob/main/class_research/Violence%20and%20Women%20in%20Office/final_presentation.pptx).

*Techniques:* Linear Regression

ðŸ“˜ **Data Science I: The Air We Breathe: Air Quality and Health Outcomes in Kentucky (Python)**

*Summary*: Much research has been conducted on the relationship between air pollution and health outcomes. For our final project, we dived deeper into this relationship in a single state in the United States: Kentucky. With 2019 data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) , we conducted an exploratory analysis with data visualization and linear regression on overall, respiratory, and mental health outcomes. Due to a very limited sample size (potential political reasons discussed), our results did not show a statistically significant relationship, but we provided recommendations for further research.
