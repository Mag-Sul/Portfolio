# Problem

-   Despite making up roughly 50 percent of the population, as of December 2021, only five countries (Rwanda, Cuba, Nicaragua, Mexico, and the United Arab Emirates) had women holding over 50 percent of parliamentary seats in the lower or single house (IPU Parline).
-   According to United Nations Women, "At the current rate of progress, gender parity in national legislative bodies will not be achieved before 2063."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Short Background/Literature Review

-   Initially we planned to examine the relationship between online violence against women and women's political participation.
-   However, this is an emerging data area and many data gaps remain.
-   For example, a November Axios article highlighted the formation of a "a first-of-its-kind database" that tracked online violence against government officials (Kingson). 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Short Background/Literature Review Contd.

- Instead, we pivoted to examine violence in relation to another proposed element contributing to the low numbers of women in elected office: the influence of childhood experiences.
- For example, based on survey data from 1,600 children ages 6 to 12, researchers Bos, et al concluded that girls report less interest in running for political office than their boy peers (Bos, Angela L., et al).
- Another study by Fox and Lawless found that even factors such as participation in school sports influences whether or not a girl says they want to run for office someday (Fox and Lawless, "Girls Just Wanna Not Run"). 
- In a separate study, Fox and Lawless also concluded that women's ***self***-***perceived*** qualifications were statistically significant in whether women considered running for office.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Theory

-   Gender socialization theory: Fox and Lawless argued that "Gender Socialization Theory" provides a framework to better understand the lack of women in politics, meaning that the traditional exclusion of women from the public sphere continues to have an impact on on current levels of representation (Fox and Lawless, "Entering the Arena?"). 
-   Our hypothesis is that the levels of violence against girls in high school will have a negative correlation on the levels of women in politics at both the state and federal level.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Data and Method

-   Data pulled from Institute for Women's Policy Research which compiles detailed data in a project titled "Status of Women in the States."
-   2015 Violence and Safety: consists of "available state-level data on the percent of high school students experiencing harassment or bullying and dating violence, and state statutes on violence and employment, domestic violence, sexual violence, stalking, and gun ownership."
-   2015 Political Participation: consists of "state-level data on women in congress and state legislatures; women of color in congress, state legislatures and statewide elected offices; and institutional resources."
- Additional datasets for further analysis: 2015 education data, fips data, 2016 election data (states whose electoral votes went to the democratic candidate versus the republican candidate)

# Interpretation of the Results

-   The coefficient of difference percent in experiencing sexual dating violence is significant at 5% level on political participation (both congress and house)
-   An increase of sexual dating violence with one percent is associated with an increase of political participation difference of 8 percent
-   The main conclusion is that a relationship between gender gap regarding **sexual dating violence** and **gender gap** of political participation reflecting by both the congress and house female and male representative rate

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Limitations

-   Missing data:
    -   The actual domestic violence number is known, because of **unreported** domestic violence
    -   Awareness of domestic violence is growing, the total amount maybe decrease but the with the reported rate increase we still can't have the whole trend
    -   The definition of domestic violence has changed over time. For example, **intimate partner violence** start to be notice until recent days.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Limitations

-   Reversal Causation:the increasing female representatives and senator can design more policies women violence related policies
-   Less control variable: the model's explaining power is weak, r-squared is only 0.11 after adding the control variable

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Future Work

-   missing data time-series analysis: trend and policy environment
-   adding more demographic characteristic as control variables
-   two stage least square: do the regression analysis of policy gender gap on the violence first, then the do regression of political participation on the violence
